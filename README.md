This Unity package is all you need to integrate Kamcord into a Unity project for iOS or Android. The current iOS SDK version is 1.9.2. The current AndroidÂ SDK version is 1.6.5. If you're updating from an older version, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/kamcord/Unity-Kamcord/wiki/Change-Log">Change Log</a>. You can find version numbers inside <code>Plugins/Kamcord/Kamcord.cs</code> after you import the Kamcord assets into your Unity project.

You can <b><a href="https://github.com/kamcord/Unity-Kamcord/wiki/Download">download Kamcord</a></b> and an AngryBots example integration from the wiki link also.

<b>Note to developers using Kamcord Android versions 1.6.0 - 1.6.1</b><br/>
Due to changes in our server infrastructure, these two versions will soon be unable to properly display video feeds in the Watch and Profile tabs. Please upgrade to version 1.6.2 or higher as soon as possible. Versions prior to 1.6.0 should still display feeds correctly. We apologize for the inconvenience.
